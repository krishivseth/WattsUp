Property ID,"Property IDs are unique identifiers for your property that can be used by EPA, you, or other organizations to track and manage your property. There are four main types of Property IDs:
Portfolio Manager Property IDs - This is a unique ID assigned by EPA to each property.
Portfolio Manager Parent Property IDs - If your property is a campus of buildings and you benchmark one or more ""child"" buildings individually, then each child building will be associated to its parent through this ID.
Custom IDs - A custom ID is an ID that you can set, for example, it could be an ID associated with your company or an ID for a campaign in which you are participating. When you enter a Custom ID, you can enter both a name for the ID and its actual value. For example: (Company ABC Inventory ID, 01234). When you search for these custom IDs in reports, you will see them only as Custom ID 1, Custom ID 2, and Custom ID 3, because Custom ID 1 could be different for different properties in your portfolio.
Standard IDs - A standard ID is a special type of ID with a set name that is available within Portfolio Manager. These are IDs associated with local legislation, national campaigns, or other large benchmarking activities. For example, New York City uses the Borough Block and Lot (BBL) number to track buildings in their jurisdiction. To enter a standard ID you can select the ID name from our dropdown list and then enter the value. See Standard ID for a full list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Property Name,Basic property information includes property name. The property name can be the property address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parent Property Id,The ID for the campus is referred to as the Parent Property ID.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parent Property Name,"When you are benchmark a campus (or, collection of buildings) you can track information for the entire campus, as well as for individual buildings on the campus. If you choose to track at both of these levels, then you have ""parent-child"" relationship. The ""parent"" is the entire campus or complex. That is, the parent is the multi-building property for which you have also chosen to benchmark individual buildings separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Year Ending,Calendar year,MM/DD/YYYY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NYC Borough, Block and Lot (BBL)","10-digit property borough, block and lot identifier, originally entered into the ""Standard IDs"" field in Portfolio Manager and then verified and corrected, as necessary, by the Department of Finance (DOF). The first number represents the borough, where 1 is Manhattan, 2 is the Bronx, 3 is Brooklyn, 4 is Queens, and 5 is Staten Island. The following five numbers represent the tax block. If a property has a tax block that is less than 5 digits, then zeros are added before the block number so there are five digits in total.  The last four digits are the tax lot number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NYC Building Identification Number (BIN)," A seven-digit identifier
Example: 1234567

Primary Property Type - Self Selected,"This is the primary property type that you select. You select the type with which you most closely identify and you can change it at any time (on the Details tab, under Basic Information).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Primary Property Type - Portfolio Manager-Calculated,"Portfolio Manager calculates a property type based on the property uses that you have entered. This is the property type that accounts for more than 50% of your property. For example, if you enter a property that has an Office that accounts for 60% of your Gross Floor Area (GFA) and a Retail store for 40%, the ""Portfolio Manager-Calculated"" Property Type will be ""Office."" This property type is used to determine your peer group for comparison to the National Median. If no individual property type accounts for more than 50%, then it will be designated as Mixed Use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Median Reference Property Type,"The National Median is an extremely useful benchmark: 50% of properties perform below the median, and 50% perform above the median. It represents the middle of the national population. Most property types in Portfolio Manager get their National Median from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). There are 5 exceptions where the National Median is not based on CBECS data: Data Centers, Hospitals, Multifamily, Senior Living Community, and Wastewater Treatment Plants. CBECS does not have a National Median for these 5 property types. Their Medians are based on their survey data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Year Built,"This is the year in which your property was constructed. If your property has undergone a complete renovation that included gutting and rebuilding the interior, then you can indicate the date of this renovation as the year built. The year built is not used to calculate the ENERGY STAR Score; it is simply for property information. If you don't know the exact year the property was built, enter an estimate.",YYYY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Construction Status,"Construction Status indicates whether your property is:
a design project
an existing operational property
a test property (one you are using for training or testing new features in Portfolio Manager)
You initially select your construction status when you create a property. You can change the construction status on the Details tab, under Basic Information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Number of Buildings,"Number of Buildings indicates the total number of buildings that are located on a multi-building property. You enter this value into Portfolio Manager whenever you create a multi-building property.

Please note that this value is not the number of buildings that have been individually benchmarked on a multi-building property. For example, you may operate a large university campus with 85 buildings. When you benchmark your property you indicate that there are 85 buildings, but you may only have building-level data to track 4 individual buildings on your campus. In this case, the Number of Buildings is still listed as 85, as you entered it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Occupancy,"Occupancy is the percentage of your property’s Gross Floor Area (GFA) that is occupied and operational. This is a measure of the building’s occupancy/use, it is not connected to a building’s “Maximum Occupancy.”

The value you enter for occupancy will not affect your ENERGY STAR Score or any other metrics. Your Score is based on your specific Use Details (Number of Workers, Computers, etc) and you need to update your Use Details to accurately reflect the activity at your property.

Your occupancy could affect your eligibility for ENERGY STAR certification. We have the following occupancy requirements:
Office/Bank/Courthouse/Financial Office – at least 55%
Hotel - at least 60%
Multifamily – at least 80%
If you are not seeking certification for one of the above property types, you may not find Occupancy very useful (though it is required, so enter your best guess and move on).Examples to help you determine your occupancy:
Office: Occupancy is a measure of the tenant spaces that are leased. If you have a 10-story building, and on average one floor is vacant, and the other 9 floors fully leased and occupied, then the occupancy would be 90%. If you have people working on all floors/areas of your building, then you are 100% occupied. You do not need to count empty cubicles or the number of employees who enter a property.
Hotel: Occupancy is a measure of the rooms that are sold. If you have a hotel with 100 rooms, and on average 10 rooms per night are vacant, then the occupancy is 90%.
Multifamily: Occupancy is a measure of the units that are leased. If you have a 100 apartments, and 5 are vacant for the year, then the occupancy is 95%.
Worship Facility: Occupancy is the percentage of the building that is operational, regardless of how many people are in the building. Most of the time, this will be 100%.
There is only one Occupancy rate for each property as a whole. You enter Occupancy when you first create the property, and you can change it on the Details tab. You cannot track occupancy changes over time.",Percent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metered Areas (Energy),Metered Areas is a designation of what areas within your building are covered by your energy and water meters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metered Areas (Water),Metered Areas is a designation of what areas within your building are covered by your energy and water meters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ENERGY STAR Score,"The ENERGY STAR Score is a measure of how well your property is performing relative to similar properties, when normalized for climate and operational characteristics.

The ENERGY STAR scores are based on data from national building energy consumption surveys, and this allows Portfolio Manager to control for key variables affecting a building’s energy performance, including climate, hours of operation, and building size. What this means is that buildings from around the country, with different operating parameters and subject to different weather patterns, can be compared side-by-side in order to see how they stack up in terms of energy performance. The specific factors that are included in this normalization (Hours, Workers, Climate, etc) will depend on the property type.

The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR Certification.

ENERGY STAR Scores are available for many property types.

The 1-100 scale is based on the country in which your property is located. Properties in the US are compared to the national population of properties in the US. Similarly, properties in Canada are compared to the national population of properties in Canada. At this time there are no ENERGY STAR scores specifically developed for other countries. Therefore, properties located in other countries will be compared to the US national population, by default.",1-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Median ENERGY STAR Score,"The National Median is an extremely useful benchmark: 50% of properties perform below the median, and 50% perform above the median. It represents the middle of the national population. Most property types in Portfolio Manager get their National Median from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). There are 5 exceptions where the National Median is not based on CBECS data: Data Centers, Hospitals, Multifamily, Senior Living Community, and Wastewater Treatment Plants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Target ENERGY STAR Score,"Target Values are the performance metrics associated with an established target (goal) for your property. This is the target for comparison relative to actual operation. Once your target is established, metrics such as Site EUI, Source EUI, GHG Emissions, and Energy Cost are evaluated for your target conditions. This will enable you to compare your actual energy use with your target and track your progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reason(s) for No Score,"Common reasons for not being eligible include:
Your property is not able to earn a 1-100 score
You do not have an ENERGY STAR score of 75 or higher
You have already earned ENERGY STAR certification within the last 11 months
Your energy data is more than 120 days old",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ENERGY STAR Certification - Year(s) Certified (Score),ENERGY STAR Certification - Year(s) Certified (Score) is a list of all years for which your property has been certified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ENERGY STAR Certification - Last Approval Date,"ENERGY STAR Certification - Last Approval Date is the date that we approved your last application. If your property has not earned certification, no value will display here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),The Site Energy Use divided by the property square foot.,kBtu/ft²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The energy use your property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. For example, if 2012 was a very hot year, then your Weather Normalized Site Energy may be lower than your Site Energy Use, because you would have used less energy if it had not been so hot. It can be helpful to use this weather normalized value to understand changes in energy when accounting for changes in weather. Weather Normalized Site EUI is also available (i.e. Weather Normalized Site Energy divided by property size or by flow through a water/wastewater treatment plant).",kBtu/ft²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Median Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The exact way the National Median is determined depends on the property:
If your property has an ENERGY STAR score - The National Median Source EUI is the Source EUI that will give your specific property an ENERGY STAR score of 50. This means the National Median is normalized to account for your property's weather, business activity, and fuel mix. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions.
If your property has multiple scorable property types – the National Median is a calculated average based on the proportions of the National Medians of each property type (as calculated above).
If your property has both scorable and non-scorable property types (Office & Restaurant) - the National Median is based only on the scorable property type.
If your property does not have an ENERGY STAR score - The National Median is the Source EUI from CBECS, normalized for your property's specific fuel mix, but not normalization for either weather or business operations. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions.
If a property has multiple non-scorable property types (Social Hall 70%, Food Service 30%) – the National Median for comparison is the “Portfolio Manager-Calculated Property Type” (which is the property type that is over 51% of the GFA, in this example it would be Social Hall).
If your property doesn’t have a single property type that is 51% or more - your National Median for comparison is the “Mixed Use” property type from CBECS.",kBtu/ft²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Site Energy Use (kBtu),"The annual amount of all the energy your property consumes on-site, regardless of the source. It includes energy purchased from the grid or in bulk (which are the amounts on utility bills), as well as renewable energy generated and consumed on-site such as from solar and wind (excess renewable energy generated on-site and sold to the utility is excluded from site energy use). Site Energy can be used to understand how the energy use for an individual property has changed over time.",kBtu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weather Normalized Site Energy Use (kBtu),"The energy use your property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. For example, if 2012 was a very hot year, then your Weather Normalized Site Energy may be lower than your Site Energy Use, because you would have used less energy if it had not been so hot.

Source EUI (kBtu/ft²)," Source EUI (Energy Use Intensity) is Source Energy divided by the property's Gross Floor Area. In addition to what the property consumes on-site, source energy includes losses that take place during generation, transmission, and distribution of the energy, thereby enabling a complete assessment of energy consumption resulting from building operations.",kBtu/ft²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weather Normalized Source EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The source energy use your property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions.

Source Energy Use (kBtu),"This metric is only available for properties that have an ENERGY STAR score. For a given 12-month period, this metric reflects the Source Energy Use the property would be expected to have if its operations were the same as in the current time period. For example, if you are looking at the period ending December 2008, this metric would tell you the amount of Source Energy you would have used in 2008 if your operating conditions (weather, hours, occupants) had been the same as they are for your current time period. Much like looking at financial investments in the dollars for a specific year, this adjusted value will help you understand the change in energy when accounting for changes in operation. Adjusted Source EUI is also available (i.e. Adjusted Source Energy divided by property size or by flow through a water/wastewater treatment plant).",kBtu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Green Power - Onsite (kWh),"Green Power is a generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. You may use green power directly from an on-site renewable system, or you may purchase green power from your utility or independent green power supplier. In order for power to be considered green, you must own what are called the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), or the legal claims/rights to the environmental benefits of the green power. These rights can be sold separately from the actual electricity (kWh). Therefore, please note the following distinction between Onsite and Offsite Green Power:
Onsite Green Power – Power generated from an onsite renewable system. The only types of onsite green power currently tracked in Portfolio Manager are solar and wind power. Energy use from these systems is green only if you retain the rights to the RECs associated with the power generated by your system. If you sell the RECs (for example, through REC arbitrage), then you do not have onsite green power.
Offsite Green Power – Green power purchases from your utility and/or independent purchases of RECs. If through utility purchases you acquire both electricity (kWh) and RECs, then you have the right to the Green Power. If you purchase your electricity (kWh) from your utility but your RECs from another provider, then you may attribute these RECs to your utility power.

Total (Location-Based) GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e),"Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions are the carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property. GHG emissions are expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a universal unit of measure that combines the quantity and global warming potential of each greenhouse gas. Emissions are reported in four categories, each is available as a total amount in metric tons (Metric Tons CO2e) or as an intensity value in kilograms per square foot (kgCO2e/ft2):

Direct Emissions – Direct Emissions are emissions associated with onsite fuel combustion (e.g. combustion of natural gas or fuel oil).
Indirect Emissions – Indirect Emissions are emissions associated with purchases of electricity, district steam, district hot water, or district chilled water. These emissions occur at your utility’s plant, but they are a result of your property’s energy consumption and therefore contribute to your overall GHG footprint.
Biomass Emissions– Biomass Emissions are emissions associated with biogenic fuels such as wood or biogas (captured methane). The only biomass fuel currently available in Portfolio Manager is wood. Biogenic fuels are combusted onsite, but do not contribute to Direct or Total Emissions.

Emissions are reported in four categories, each is available as a total amount in metric tons (Metric Tons CO2e) or as an intensity value in kilograms per square foot (kgCO2e/ft2):

Direct Emissions – Direct Emissions are emissions associated with onsite fuel combustion (e.g. combustion of natural gas or fuel oil).
Indirect Emissions – Indirect Emissions are emissions associated with purchases of electricity, district steam, district hot water, or district chilled water. These emissions occur at your utility’s plant, but they are a result of your property’s energy consumption and therefore contribute to your overall GHG footprint.
Biomass Emissions– Biomass Emissions are emissions associated with biogenic fuels such as wood or biogas (captured methane). The only biomass fuel currently available in Portfolio Manager is wood. Biogenic fuels are combusted onsite, but do not contribute to Direct or Total Emissions.

Avoided Emissions - Onsite Green Power (Metric Tons CO2e),"Avoided Emissions are the emissions benefits associated with green power use. Avoided emissions may be either onsite or offsite.
Onsite Avoided Emissions are the emissions benefits of your onsite renewable system (when you’ve retained the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)) due to the reduction in grid-supplied electricity. It is calculated as the amount of Onsite Green Power you consume multiplied by the non-baseload (marginal) emissions factor of your eGRID subregion.
Offsite Avoided Emissions occur when you purchase green power (which come with RECs) from your utility or an independent supplier. Offsite Avoided Emissions also occur in the case of REC arbitrage, a transaction where you sell the RECs associated with your own onsite system and purchase other substitute RECs.

Percent of Electricity that is Green Power,"Green Power is a generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. You may use green power directly from an on-site renewable system, or you may purchase green power from your utility or independent green power supplier. In order for power to be considered green, you must own what are called the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), or the legal claims/rights to the environmental benefits of the green power. These rights can be sold separately from the actual electricity (kWh). Therefore, please note the following distinction between Onsite and Offsite Green Power:
Onsite Green Power – Power generated from an onsite renewable system. The only types of onsite green power currently tracked in Portfolio Manager are solar and wind power. Energy use from these systems is green only if you retain the rights to the RECs associated with the power generated by your system. If you sell the RECs (for example, through REC arbitrage), then you do not have onsite green power.
Offsite Green Power – Green power purchases from your utility and/or independent purchases of RECs. If through utility purchases you acquire both electricity (kWh) and RECs, then you have the right to the Green Power. If you purchase your electricity (kWh) from your utility but your RECs from another provider, then you may attribute these RECs to your utility power. Offsite Green power sources in Portfolio Manager include Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biogas (Landfill gas), Biomass, and Small Hydropower.",Percent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Percent of RECs Retained,The percentage of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that you kept/(own) compared to the total quantity of RECs associated with the onsite renewable energy you generated. It does not include RECs that you traded in REC Arbitrage,Percent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Percent of Total Electricity Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems,"The percentage of your total electricity use that is supplied by your onsite renewable system, regardless of REC ownership. For example, if your building used 100 kWh this year and 60 kWh came from your onsite renewable system, and 40 kWh were purchased from the grid), then your Percent Electricity Sourced from Onsite Renewable Systems is 60% (60/100). This is not affected by any renewable energy that you exported.",Percent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single building
Campus of buildings
Part of a building (such as a single tenant space).
Depending on which above type you have, your exact GFA is determined differently:
“Single buildings” and “campuses of buildings” measure the GFA between the outside surface of the exterior walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) including supporting areas. GFA is not the same as rentable space, but rather includes all area inside the building(s).
Include in GFA: lobbies, tenant areas, common areas, meeting rooms, break rooms, atriums (count the base level only), restrooms, elevator shafts, stairwells, mechanical equipment areas, basements, storage rooms.
Do not include in GFA: exterior spaces, balconies, patios, exterior loading docks, driveways, covered walkways, outdoor play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.), parking (How to enter parking?), the interstitial plenum space between floors (which house pipes and ventilation), crawl spaces.
Although you do not include these areas in your GFA, you do include their energy use. Our algorithms assume buildings have outdoor usage, too. The GFA refers specifically to interior space. But, the energy use evaluated should be all the energy required to operate your building, which includes the energy used both inside and out.
You may exclude the GFA of certain Property Uses, if they meet these 4 criteria (see this FAQ for details):
The Property Use is less than 10% of the building’s GFA
The Property Use is not a property type eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score
The Property Use is sub-metered so that both the Property Use’s energy consumption and GFA can be excluded

Data Center - UPS System Redundancy,"IT Energy is the amount of energy required by the server racks, storage silos, and other IT equipment in the Data Center. IT Energy is a measure of energy (i.e. kWh), it should not be reported as an instantaneous reading of electric demand.

IT Energy may be measured at any of 4 locations:
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Output (required for a score, in most cases)
Power Distribution Unit (PDU) Input
PDU Output
Server/Equipment Input
IT Energy meters permit readings for a user-determined time period (e.g. weekly, monthly, or quarterly). Monthly measurements are recommended, on schedule with utility readings, if possible.

In order to receive an ENERGY STAR score, the IT energy must be measured at the UPS Output. However, you may track IT energy at the other measurement locations for your own purposes. A measurement of IT Energy from the UPS Output is consistent with a Category 1 measurement of data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), as recommended by EPA and other leading organizations. In the following circumstances only, EPA will permit alternate measurement approaches based on the IT configuration:
Data Centers that do not have a UPS are permitted to supply readings from the input to the PDU.
Data Centers for which more than 10% of the UPS load is directed to non-IT (e.g. mechanical) equipment are required to provide a reading that excludes the non-IT equipment. Two options are permitted:
If energy used by non-IT equipment is measured, then you can subtract the non-IT energy from the total UPS energy, and enter the remainder into your UPS Output Meter.
If energy used by non-IT equipment is not measured, then you can supply a reading from the input to the PDU that supports the IT equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Center - IT Energy Configuration,Data Center IT Energy Configuration describes how your IT load is powered and therefore will determine where you must measure IT Energy to earn an ENERGY STAR score for a Data Center.

Data Center - Energy Estimates Applied,"Apply Data Center Energy Estimates is entered as either Yes or No.
Yes - Estimates for energy consumption will be applied for this data center. Estimates are applied to all data centers in Canada.
No - IT Energy is metered and entered in Portfolio Manager, and will be used to determine an ENERGY STAR score for this property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Center - Cooling Equipment Redundancy,"Cooling Equipment Redundancy describes the redundant capacity of the cooling equipment in a Data Center. Redundant cooling equipment is typically required in a Data Center to have backup cooling in case of a cooling equipment failure (not a power outage). The specific level of redundancy will depend on your particular Data Center. Cooling Equipment Redundancy is not required, nor is it factored into any metrics

If there are multiple systems operating at different levels of redundancy, choose the option that applies to the majority of the data center cooling load.

If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single building
Campus of buildings
Part of a building (such as a single tenant space).
Depending on which above type you have, your exact GFA is determined differently:
“Single buildings” and “campuses of buildings” measure the GFA between the outside surface of the exterior walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) including supporting areas. GFA is not the same as rentable space, but rather includes all area inside the building(s).
Include in GFA: lobbies, tenant areas, common areas, meeting rooms, break rooms, atriums (count the base level only), restrooms, elevator shafts, stairwells, mechanical equipment areas, basements, storage rooms.
Do not include in GFA: exterior spaces, balconies, patios, exterior loading docks, driveways, covered walkways, outdoor play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.), parking (How to enter parking?), the interstitial plenum space between floors (which house pipes and ventilation), crawl spaces.
Although you do not include these areas in your GFA, you do include their energy use. Our algorithms assume buildings have outdoor usage, too. The GFA refers specifically to interior space. But, the energy use evaluated should be all the energy required to operate your building, which includes the energy used both inside and out.
You may exclude the GFA of certain Property Uses, if they meet these 4 criteria (see this FAQ for details):
The Property Use is less than 10% of the building’s GFA
The Property Use is not a property type eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score
The Property Use is sub-metered so that both the Property Use’s energy consumption and GFA can be excluded

Multifamily Housing – The Total Number of Residential Living Units should count all individual private apartments/condominiums. There are three additional Property Use Details, which break this total into three different categories, according to building height. If your property has only one building, or if all buildings are of the same height, then you should enter “zero” for the other two categories. Portfolio Manager requires that the sum of these three values equal your Total Number of Residential Living Units:
Number of Residential Living Units in a Low-rise (1-4 stories) – This includes all units located in an individual building that is 1 to 4 stories in height.
Number of Residential Living Units in a Mid-rise (5-9 stories) –This includes all units located in an individual building that is 5 to 9 stories in height.

The following options are available:
No specific resident population: The property is not inhabited by any dedicated population.
Dedicated Student: Privately owned, off-campus housing -- not affiliated with a college or university -- that is primarily occupied by undergraduate or graduate students.
Dedicated Military: Off-base housing primarily occupied by persons serving in or employed by the military.
Dedicated Senior/Independent Living: Housing that is restricted to the elderly that also provides limited programs of assistance with domestic activities (meals, housekeeping, activities, transportation, etc.). Typically, a unit in an Independent Living Community resembles a standard market unit, though the community may offer amenities or communal dining facilities not typical in multifamily apartment buildings.

Independent Living Communities generally are not licensed and generally do not provide assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) or healthcare, such as the management of medications and assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating, eating and other similar activities.
Dedicated Special Accessibility Needs: Residents living in the property are covered by the American Disabilities Act.
Other Dedicated housing (please specify): - Use this selection to indicate another type of dedicated resident population.
